Foodtaster Example Project
==========

This little project shows hot to use Foodtaster to write integration
specs for your chef cookbooks.

Run cookbook specs as usual with `rspec spec` command.

Foodtaster is in early development stage, so don't expect too much
from code and functionality.

### TODO ###

move spec/foodtaster into standalone gem
